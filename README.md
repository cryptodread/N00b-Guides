# N00b-Guides
## Guides that help me to install or build stuff when the actual guides go over my head or leave out stuff

Things I've attempted to do:

1) Package up an app called Cwtch for the EmbassyOS. I've taken notes on that here. (WORK IN PROGRESS)

2) Install Ubuntu on a Raspi4, and build Bitcoin Core from source on it. I've taken notes on that here. (WORK IN PROGRESS)

3) Build LND from source on the same Raspi4. I've taken notes on that here. (WORK IN PROGRESS)
