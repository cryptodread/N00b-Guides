## Guides that help me to install or build stuff when the actual guide go over my head or leave out stuff

So far I've attempted three things:

1) Package up an app called Cwtch for the EmbassyOS. I've taken notes on that here.

2) Install Ubuntu on a Raspi4, and build Bitcoin Core from source on it. I've taken notes on that here.

3) Build LND from source on the same Raspi4. I've taken notes on that here.
