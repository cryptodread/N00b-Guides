# N00b-Guides
## Guides that help me to install or build stuff when the actual guides go over my head or leave out stuff

Things I've attempted to do:

1) Package up an app called Cwtch for the EmbassyOS.  (WORK IN PROGRESS)

2) Install Ubuntu on a Raspi4, and build Bitcoin Core from source on it. (WORK IN PROGRESS)

3) Build LND from source on the same Raspi4.  (WORK IN PROGRESS)
